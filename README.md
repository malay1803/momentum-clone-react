# momentum-clone-react

Momentum is a famous personal dashboard used by many coders in general. I tried to make a clone with React using hooks and various apis to practice react.

## Features

1. Add and remove your "Main Focus of the Day" (data persist on refresh).
2. Weather of your location.
3. Search Bar with through which we can search on google, youtube, and stackoverflow (as these are the most visited places for a coder ;)).
4. Some really catch Mantras(to decrease a bit of stress and motivate you).
5. Quote of the day (to inspire you).

## Drawbacks

1. Does not have advanced features like the Real Momentum app as this clone is just made for practice.
2. Does not ask the user for login as it does not include any backend.
3. Did not added features like ToDo, favourite Quote etc.
4. The site is not responsive.

## APis used

1. openweathermap: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. quotes.rest: https://quotes.rest/

Also used https://source.unsplash.com/ to change background image automatically daily.
